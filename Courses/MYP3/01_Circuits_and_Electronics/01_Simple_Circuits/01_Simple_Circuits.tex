    \section{Technical Background} 

    While a full understanding of electricity is beyond the scope of this course, a basic understanding of some terminology and components is required to understand the technical skills you will be developing. Below is a very simple overview to get us started.

    \subsection{Electrical Circuits}
 
    %TODO: Fix this "hack" for definition tables.
    \begin{tabularx}{\boxwidth}{| X |}
        \hline
        \DefinitionBoxHeader\\\hline
    \end{tabularx}

    \vspace*{-1pt}
    \begin{tabularx}{\boxwidth}{| >{\bfseries}p{0.15\boxwidth} | X |}
        Electrical Circuit & An \emph{electrical circuit} is any path from a \emph{source} of electricity to a \emph{ground}. \\\hline
        Source & A \emph{source} is anything that provides electrical energy, such as power plant, solar panels, or a battery. \\\hline
        Ground / Return & The \emph{ground} or \emph{return} in an electrical circuit is the destination for electrical energy.\\\hline
    \end{tabularx}


    \subsubsection*{Examples}
    Here are a few examples of common electrical circuits.

    \begin{figure}[h]
        \centering
        \begin{subfigure}[t]{0.45\boxwidth}
            \centering
            \includegraphics[height=6cm]{Extras/house_electricity}
            \caption*{A simple home electrical circuit.}
        \end{subfigure}
        \begin{subfigure}[t]{0.45\boxwidth}
            \centering
            \includegraphics[height=6cm]{Extras/flashlight_electricity}
            \caption*{The electrical circuit in a flashlight.}
        \end{subfigure}
    \end{figure}

    Of course, electrical circuits are not that interesting if they don't \emph{do} anything. This is where the concept of a \emph{load} comes into play.

    \medskip
    \begin{tabularx}{\boxwidth}{| >{\bfseries}p{0.15\boxwidth} | X |}
        \hline
        Load & A \emph{load} in an electrical circuit is anything that consumes electrical energy to produce some result.\\\hline
    \end{tabularx}

    \bigskip
    \begin{tabularx}{\boxwidth}{| X | }
        \hline
        \ATLHeader{Communication Skills} \\\hline
        \ATLSkill{...make inferences and draw conclusions...} \\\hline
        \QuestionBox{Briefly describe the \emph{loads} typical to the two electrical circuits given above.} \\\hline
        \ \\[6cm]\hline
    \end{tabularx}

    \subsection{Simple Components}
    We are going to build a few simple circuits to explore electricity and its variosu applications. Here is a list of the components we will need for this first lesson.

    \medskip
    \begin{tabularx}{\boxwidth}{| >{\bfseries}p{0.15\boxwidth} | X | >{\centering\arraybackslash}p{0.15\boxwidth} | >{\centering\arraybackslash}p{0.15\boxwidth}| }
        \hline
        \BoxHeader{1}{Name} & \BoxHeader{1}{Description} & \BoxHeader{1}{Symbol} & \BoxHeader{1}{Example} \\\hline
        Coin Battery & A \emph{coin battery} works just like a battery you're probably already familiar with such as the typical AA or AAA batteries, except its shape resembles a coin. These batteries typically provide 3 volts of electrical energy. 
        
        \medskip
        The image on the right is of a common CR2032, named because it has a diameter of 20mm and a thickness of 3.2mm. & \raisebox{-1cm}{\tikz \draw(0, 0) node[below,xshift=20] {+} to [battery1] (2, 0);} & \includegraphics[width=0.9\boxwidth,valign=t]{Extras/coin_battery} \\\hline

        Light-Emitting Diode (LED) & A \emph{light-emitting diode}, or LED, is a typical light source in electronic circuits and many consumer devices. They are available in a wide variety of colours and sizes. The one shown on the right has a red lens with a diameter of 5mm. 
        
        \medskip
        Note that an LED only allows electricity to flow in one direction, noted by the arrow in the symbol and, typically, a flat side of the lens and shorter leg.
        & \raisebox{-1cm}{\tikz \draw(0, 0) to [full led] (2, 0);} & \includegraphics[width=0.9\boxwidth,valign=t]{Extras/led} \\\hline

        Push Button & A push button is a mechanical switch which ``closes'' or ``opens'' and electrical circuit. 
        
        \medskip
        The ones included in your electronics kit are ``normally-open, momentary'' push buttons. This means that if you don't press them, the electrical circuit is open (normally-open), and a spring forces the button to return to its default position after you release it (momentary). 
        & \raisebox{-1cm}{\tikz \draw(0, 0) to [push button] (2, 0);} & \includegraphics[width=0.9\boxwidth,valign=t]{Extras/pushbutton} \\\hline    
    \end{tabularx}
    
    \medskip
    Note that the symbols listed above will be useful when expressing circuits in circuit diagrams, explained below.

    \subsection{Circuit Diagrams}
    A circuit diagram uses symbols and lines to represent electrical circuits in a simplified way. Below is an example of a simple circuit diagram.

    \vspace*{1cm}

    \begin{minipage}{0.33\boxwidth}
        \begin{center}
            \begin{circuitikz}[scale=1.25]
                \draw(0, 1) node[left,yshift=-6] {+} to [battery1] (0, 0); 
                \draw(0, 1) to (0, 2) to (1, 2) to [push button] (2, 2)  to (3, 2) to  (3, 1) to [full led] (3, 0) to (3, -1) to (0, -1) to (0, 0);
            \end{circuitikz}
        \end{center}
    \end{minipage}
    \begin{minipage}{0.05\boxwidth}

                \ATLSkill{...use and interpret a range of discipline-specific terms and symbols...} \\\hline
                \QuestionBox{Identify and label each of the components in the diagram on the left.} \\\hline
                \ATLSkill{...make inferences and draw conclusions...} \\\hline
                \QuestionBox{What do the lines show in a circuit diagram?} \\\hline
                \ \\[1.25cm]\hline
            \end{tabularx}
        \end{center}
    \end{minipage}

    \textbf{Note:} You might have learned in Physics class that electricity is the flow of electrons from a source of negative potential to positive. This is called the ``Electron Flow'' model of electricity. However, this is an understanding of physics that is \emph{newer} than the study of electrical circuits. In so-called ``Conventional Flow'', we think of electricity as flowing from positive to negative. Although technically wrong, this understanding does not impact how we build our circuits.

    \medskip
    All of the circuit diagrams you see in this course, as well as a majority of diagrams you'll find elsewhere, are written under the conventional flow assumption.

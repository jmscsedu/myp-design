    \section{Technical Background}
    The transistor is a fairly complex device. As such, this lesson represents only a small fraction of the knowledge you would need to use them effectively in original circuits. Nonetheless, you'll be able to explore a basic use of the transistor necessary for future projects in the following sections and example circuits.

    \medskip
    The development of the transistor represented a very important turning point even within the electronics industry. Various documentaries and other historical accounts are linked for you on the course stream, if you wish to know more.

        Bipolar Junction (BJT) & A \emph{bipolar junction transistor} is what is traditionally referred to when a ``transistor'' is mentioned. It is considered a \emph{current amplifier} as small fluctuations in its \emph{base pin} can allow large current to flow from its \emph{collector} to its \emph{emitter}.

        The symbol and example on the right are for a \emph{NPN Bipolar Junction Transistor}, the type of transistor that will be in your electronics kit.

        Field Effect (FET) & A \emph{field effect transistor} is one of the most important and widely used type of transistors in modern electronic devices, such as cell phones and computers. They are considered \emph{voltage amplifiers}, as small voltages applied to their \emph{gate pins} allow large voltages to flow between their \emph{drain pins} and \emph{source pins}.

        \medskip
        The symbol and example on the right are for a typical \emph{Metal-Oxide Field Effect Transistor (MOSFET)}.

    \subsection{Transistors as Switches}
    One simple use for a transistor is as an electronic \emph{switch}. Unlike the pushbutton switches explored earlier, transistors can control the flow of electricity almost autonomously through the application of a small amount of current to its \emph{base pin}.

    \subsubsection*{The Pins of a NPN BJT}

    \begin{minipage}{0.6\boxwidth}
        A transistor is a \emph{tripole} component, meaning it has three pins to connect within a circuit. The diagram on the right labels the three pins as the \emph{collector}, \emph{base}, and \emph{emitter}.

        \medskip
        In a circuit, the flow of electricity should be considered as passing through the collector to the emitter. A small, positive current to the base pin will allow for this flow of electricity.
    \end{minipage}
    \begin{minipage}{0.1\boxwidth}
    \ 
    \end{minipage}
    \begin{minipage}{0.25\boxwidth}
        \begin{circuitikz}
            \draw (0, 0) node[npn,scale=1.25] (npn) {}
                (npn.base) node[anchor=east] {Base ($+$)}
                (npn.collector) node[anchor=south] {Collector ($+$)}
                (npn.emitter) node[anchor=north] {Emitter ($-$)};
            \draw (-0.25, 0) circle (0.75);
        \end{circuitikz}
    \end{minipage}

    \subsubsection*{Leaking Current}
    It is important to note that unlike with physical switches where the flow of electricity when they are \emph{open} is nearly impossible, a bipolar junction transistor often ``leaks'' a small amount of current across its collector/emitter pins, even when no current is being applied to its base pins. This will likely be evident in the example circuit given in the next section.

    \section{Developing Technical Skills}

    \subsection{Circuit \#14}
    This circuit uses a transistor triggered by a very small electrical current as a ``switch'' to turn on the LED. Once built, you will be able to turn on the LED by bridging the gap between the two open ends with your finger.

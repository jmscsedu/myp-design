    You must determine a \emph{problem} that would benefit from the use of either one or both of the circuits above. You must then create a product that will accomplish some meaningful task to solve that problem. All decisions on what your final product will do should be based on your own ideas and/or research.

    \subsection*{Specifications}
    For this project, you must use each of the components (resistor, light dependent resistor, and transistor) ; however, the selction of the ``load'' can be based on your own specifications with consultation with the teacher regarding available materials and supplies.

    \medskip
    Your final product should be a complete or prototype of a complete product, and not just an implemented circuit.
    \subsection*{Assessment}
    You will be assessed on all sixteen objective strands presented in the design cycle and must produce a design report detailing your process and final product.
